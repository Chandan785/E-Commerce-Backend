Place your Postman screenshots in this folder using the filenames below so they display in the project README.

Expected filenames and descriptions:

- add-to-cart.png         — POST /api/cart/add (request + response)
- get-cart.png            — GET /api/cart/:userId (cart contents)
- remove-from-cart.png    — DELETE /api/cart/remove (request + response)
- create-order.png        — POST /api/orders (order creation response)
- health-check.png        — GET / (health-check response)
- get-product.png         — GET /api/products/:id (single product)
- get-products.png        — GET /api/products (list + pagination)

Tips:
- Use PNG files for best quality.
- Keep images under 1–2 MB to speed up repository load.
- After adding images, commit them and push to GitHub; the README will render them automatically.
